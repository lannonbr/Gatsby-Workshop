### Jan 15, 2019 | Syracuse JS Meetup | Syracuse CoWorks

# What is Gatsby?

Static Site Generator built in React & GraphQL

TL;DR: It makes lightning fast sites with modern web technologies ðŸš€

---

# Who uses it?

- Reactjs.org - The creators of React are using Gatsby.
- stitchfix.com - Mike Vormwald's employer's public facing site is using Gatsby
- (Soon) syracuse.io - Mike and I are rewriting it from Hugo into Gatsby
- More on Gatsby's [Site Showcase](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/showcase/)

---

# Some Notes

- You don't need much of a background with React.
- I'll go into GraphQL but give fairly small yet concrete examples of how we'll use it.
- I'm going to focus on key portions of Gatsby & the features people quickly notice.
- If you understand basic HTML, CSS, JS, I hope you should be able to follow along

---

# Setup

`npx gatsby new my-gatsby-site`

or

[Gatsby on CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

---

# Start up the site

`gatsby develop`

What are some interesting things we see?

---

# Some Gatsby magic

- No flash between page loads.
- The image goes from a low res to a high res as it loads in

---

# Gatsby `<Image>` and `<Link>`

React Components that wrap `<a>` and `<img>` with some enhancements ðŸŽ‰

---

# Gatsby-link Component

- href -> to
- Loads pages asynchronously through [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
- Still is an `<a>` tag when rendered out.

---

# Gatsby-image Component

- lazy loading. a 2MB image may be nice but it shouldn't be loaded on first render.
- Uses the `<picture>` tag. Passes image to fit your viewport.
- Will render full size image as well using Intersection Observer

---

# Basic Image Component

```js
import gatsbyAstronaut from "../images/gatsby-astronaut.png";

<Img src={gatsbyAstronaut} />;
```

We'll improve this later

---

# Creating a new page

Let's play around and add some things

---

# Break

Head to the bathroom, get a drink, relax for a bit.

Be back in 10 minutes

![GraphQL logo](./graphql.png)

# GraphQL Intro

Gatsby's main data layer where everything can be sourced from

---

# What is GraphQL?

A data query language developed by Facebook.

Rather than hitting tons of URLs as you do in a REST api, you have one endpoint to create queries from.

---

# Sample Query

```graphql
{
  allFile {
    edges {
      node {
        # Data from all files being sourced from the filesystem
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Let's explore things with <i>GraphiQL</i>

---

# Where does allFile come from?

Plugins! `gatsby-transformer-filesystem` specifically.

Let's look at `gatsby-config.js` for a deeper look.

---

# Entry for gatsby-source-filesystem

```js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    name: `images`,
    path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
  },
}
```

---

# Let's enhance our Image Component

- Gatsby-transform-sharp: Transformer plugin to take images and transform them with the Sharp image processing Library

---

# Image query

```
query {
  placeholderImage: file(relativePath: { eq: "gatsby-astronaut.png" }) {
    childImageSharp {
      fluid(maxWidth: 300) {
        ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# StaticQuery W/ Gatsby-Image tag

```jsx
<StaticQuery
  query={/* Query from last slide */}
  render={data => {
    return <Img fluid={data.placeholderImage.childImageSharp.fluid} />;
  }}
/>
```

---

# What else can we do with Plugins?

- Transform local data - [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark), [gatsby-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-mdx/), [gatsby-transformer-csv](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-csv)
- Load from CMSs or APIs - gatsby-source-meetup, gatsby-source-wordpress
- Add PWA capabilities - gatsby-plugin-offline, gatsby-plugin-manifest
- And so much more. Currently over 600 plugins for Gatsby
